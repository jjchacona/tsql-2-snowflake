# tsql-2-snowflake
An automated way to reformat TSQL Stored Procedures to Snowflake JavaScript based Stored Procedures

main_formatter.py will format (not convert) TSQL statements into Javascript/SQL commands.

IMPORTANT: You MUST add a semi-colon ( ; ) at the end of each statement inside of your Stored Procedure

tsql_scoring_tool.py gives you an idea of how many components in your TSQL procedures are TSQL specific.
